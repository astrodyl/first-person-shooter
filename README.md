# Next Level Hangout
_Next Level Hangout_ is a multiplayer first person shooter that I developed for fun. It's the first 
video game that I've built. It is quite terrible in just about every way, but it is easily one of
the most enjoyable projects that I have ever worked on. 

Check out the wiki for more information!

# How to Play
Run the the executable `fps.exe` located in `/release/v1.0`.

### Creating a room
After loading into the game, you'll be presented with an option to create or join a room. To create a
room, simply decide on a name of the lobby and click _create_. You'll be immediately entered into the 
lobby and you'll be able to see the list of players. You can either start the game, or wait for your
friends to find the lobby and join. Once you're ready click the _start_ button.

Lobbies are limited to 10 players and region locked to the East coast of the United States.
